This concern adds an `eTag` header to every response generated by the server
so that clients send a `If-None-Match` header to validate their cache. If the
content did not change on the server, the handler will generate a `304 Not Modified`
response, causing the client to re-use the locally cached data. This way, clients
revisiting your web application load faster and the load on your server is reduced.

```csharp
var content = Layout.Create()
                    .Add(ClientCache.Validation());
```

The `eTag` is generated from the [checksum of the content](https://github.com/Kaliumhexacyanoferrat/GenHTTP/blob/master/API/Protocol/IResponseContent.cs) 
that should be served to the client. Dependent on the kind of content (such as a local file resource)
the checksum can be calculated quite efficiently.

This concern is part of the [default configuration](../defaults/) and will automatically
be added to your server.
