## Getting Support

If you have questions or run into issues while building applications with the GenHTTP webserver framework,
our community is here to help. You can reach us through:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/Kaliumhexacyanoferrat/GenHTTP) discussions and issue tracking
- Our community [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/GwtDyUpkpV)

Both platforms are actively monitored and are great places to get guidance, report problems,
or exchange ideas with other GenHTTP users.

## Commercial Options

GenHTTP is an open-source project, and the community channels above are available to everyone -
including companies using GenHTTP in production environments.

If you require extended, professional support such as workshops, prioritized feature
development, architectural consulting, or dedicated development teams, please contact
[solutions@genhttp.org](mailto:solutions@genhttp.org).

GenHTTP is led and supported by senior engineers from a Swiss IT service provider specialized in delivering
robust enterprise solutions.
