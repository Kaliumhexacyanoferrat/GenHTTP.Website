## Webservices

The webservice module provides an easy way to implement RESTful services
that can be consumed by clients as needed.

> <span class="note">NOTE</span> Webservices can quickly be created by using a [project template](./templates).

## Creating a Webservice

The concept is very similar to popular webservice frameworks
such as [JAX-RS](https://github.com/jax-rs):

```csharp
using GenHTTP.Modules.Webservices;
using GenHTTP.Modules.Security;

public class BookResource
{

    [ResourceMethod]
    public List<Book> GetBooks(int page, int pageSize) { /* ... */ }

    [ResourceMethod(":id")]
    public Book? GetBook(int id) { /* ... */ }

    [ResourceMethod(RequestMethod.PUT)]
    public Book AddBook(Book book) { /* ... */ }
                        
    [ResourceMethod(RequestMethod.POST)]
    public Book UpdateBook(Book book) { /* ... */ }

    [ResourceMethod(RequestMethod.DELETE, ":id")]
    public Book? DeleteBook(int id) { /* ... */ }

}

var service = Layout.Create()
                    .AddService<BookResource>("books")
                    .Add(CorsPolicy.Permissive());

Host.Create()
    .Handler(service)
    .Run();
```

The service will be available at http://localhost:8080/books.
As the functionality is provided on handler level,
all other concerns such as [authentication](./authentication), [error handling](./error-handling)
or [CORS](./cors) can be implemented using regular server mechanisms. 

By default, parameter values (within the path) are expected
to be alphanumeric. If needed, a custom pattern can be specified
to define the format accepted by the service:

```csharp
[ResourceMethod("(?<id>[0-9]{12,13})")] // EAN-13
public Book? GetBook(int id) { /* ... */ }
```

Because the resource hander needs to utilize regular expressions
and reflection to achieve the required functionality, its performance
will be slow compared to `IHandler` instances
providing the same functionality.

The implementation supports all typical features such as
serialization and deserialization of complex types, simple
types, enums, streams, raw `IRequest`, `IHandler`, and `IResponseBuilder`
arguments, query parameters, path parameters, `async` methods returning
a `Task` or `ValueTask`, and exception handling:

```csharp
[ResourceMethod(RequestMethod.PUT)]
public async ValueTask<Stream> Stream(Stream input) { /* ... */ }

[ResourceMethod]
public IResponseBuilder RequestResponse(IRequest request, IHandler handler) { return request.Respond() /* ... */; }

[ResourceMethod]
public void Exception() => throw new ProviderException(ResponseStatus.AlreadyReported, "Already reported!");
```
